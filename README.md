1. Start with run_first.rda. This installs the necessary packages, loads helper function. Change the paths as necessary and run this code.
2. The analysis is broken into several chunks within ?analysis? folder
3. Main_effects.rda generates the pre-treatment effects and the associated table.
4. Interaction_effects.rda generates the plots for the two-way interactions.
5. Three_effects.rda (working on this) generates the three way interactions.
6. The original, untouched data are data.dta; the codebook is also in the folder. I recode all the data using. Recode.rda and I save the data as raw_data.rda ? this is the data that I use throughout all the analyses.
